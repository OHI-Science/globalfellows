The home page of our website we envision as being a timeline with our progress on the OHI adventure. The timeline will be a vertical line, the top being time 0 (January 2018, when we started learning the necesary tools), and the bottom being x (September 2018, when we finally have OHI scores!). Along the timeline we think on having different points showing our achievements, issues, problems, comments through out the process. These notes are going to be devided in the following section (each one representig a tab of the website): Blog, R &Rmarkdown, Github and OHI Theory. The description of each tab/section is describing bellow.
