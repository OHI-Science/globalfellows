## How to Calculate a Goal Score
***


![](images/ohi_flowchart.png)

***

Each of the [ten goals](https://www.nature.com/articles/nature11397) have their own unique methodology. [Methodologies](https://rawgit.com/OHI-Science/ohi-global/draft/global_supplement/Supplement.html#5_goal_models_and_data) are built around the types of available data, appropriate for the analysis -- consistently quantified across the spatial scale of the assessment and quality-controlled -- and based on the best scientific understanding of the subject per expert input and peer review. Each goal score calculation takes a few different [data layers](http://ohi-science.org/ohi-global/layers_table.html) that inform present status and likely near-term future status, which is calculated from trend, pressure, and resilience information.
