<p>
Camila is originally from Santiago, Chile and holds a degree in Biology from Pontificia Universidad Católica de Chile (PUC), with a major in ecology and specialization in natural resources management. Her working experiences has mostly been related to academic research for the Marine Conservation Center – PUC, exploring social-ecological systems dynamics in small-scale fisheries in Chile.
</p>
<p>
Camila’s primary research focused on gender roles in small-scale fisheries along the coast of central Chile. She has also collaborated on a range of projects, from research to review biodiversity offset’s in the scientific literature, to an initiative with a PNUD project aimed to develop a credit system for marine biodiversity offsets for the central coast of Chile. She has also been involved in several field works assessing fishers’ perceptions on adaptive capacity and evaluating fishers’ collaborative behavior through game theory experiments.  
</p>
<p>
She is currently perusing a master degree at the Bren School of Environmental Science and Management, as a Latina America Fisheries Fellowship, with specialization is in Coastal Marine Resource Management. For her masters project, Camila is working with the Clawless Lobster Team, developing a user-friendly tool to integrate scientific knowledge and experience of creating Fish Refuges (aka No-take Marine Reserves), based on the experience in the Mexican Caribbean. 
</p>
<p>
Her focus on marine resources is motivated by her passion for ocean and marine life as well as her desire to develop solutions, using the best available science, for threatened coastal resources which are the main livelihood for many coastal communities.

<p>
Iwen grew up in San Diego and Taiwan, and received her B.A. in Biology, Marine Emphasis from Occidental College. After graduating, she set off to Madagascar for three months to conduct underwater surveys on coral reefs. She has also volunteered on various projects throughout San Diego, including coral identification at the Scripps Institution of Oceanography, event planning for WildCoast, and scientific diving with San Diego State graduate students. During this time, Iwen primarily worked along the coast collecting recreational fisheries data for the CA Department of Fish and Wildlife and on the water for a white seabass enhancement project at the Hubbs-Seaworld Research Institute. 
</p>
<p>
She is now pursuing a specialization in Coastal and Marine Resources Management at the Bren School. Over the last year and half, she’s worked on various projects at NCEAS including the Arctic Data Center, the SeaSketch-TNC groundfish spatial plan, and now the Ocean Health Index. Her career interests include marine spatial planning for fisheries and aquaculture and seafood sustainability. Outside of school, Iwen enjoys diving artificial reefs, and drawing pictures of sea-creatures to hang on her walls.

<p>
Ellie graduated from the Bren School of Environmental Science & Management, where she pursued a Masters of Environmental Science and Management with a specialization in Energy and Climate. Originally from Anchorage, Alaska, Ellie graduated from Colorado College in 2016 with a B.A. in Mathematics. For her masters project, she collaborated with four peers to synthesize an ecological monitoring framework for the Tejon Ranch Conservancy, incorporating drones and other remote sensing technologies. She previously worked with Conservation Science Partners on GLUED (Global Land Use/Cover Emergent Database), a platform to collect and share data on land use and land cover. She gained additional technical training in remote sensing methodology through an interdisciplinary research experience for undergraduates at the University of Northern Iowa. In her free time, she enjoys spending time outdoors skiing, running, and playing ultimate frisbee.
