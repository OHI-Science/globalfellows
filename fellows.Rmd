<p>
Gage grew up in Manteo, North Carolina, a town located on a small island in the Outer Banks. He graduated from the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill in 2018 with a B.S. in Statistics and Analytics and a B.A. in Music. Throughout college Gage performed in many of UNC’s ensembles, including the Jazz, Trumpet, and Wind Ensembles. Although he has a passion for music, his passion for statistics and the environment is stronger. Seeing firsthand the effects of environmental degradation on his hometown inspired his interest in environmental science.
</p>
<p>
He is now a first-year student at the Bren School, pursuing a specialization in Coastal Marine Resources Management with a focus in Environmental Data Science. He hopes to pursue a career in which he can apply his analytical skills to solve environmental issues and preserve the livelihoods of those living in coastal communities.  In his free time, Gage is an avid trumpet player, hiker, and general outdoorsy person.

### Molly Williams
<div style="width: 100%;">
<img src="images/molly.jpg" style="float: right; width: 34%; margin: 0px 6px;" />
<p>
Molly is originally from Seattle, WA and grew up in and around the Pacific Ocean. She received her undergraduate degree in Environmental Studies on the other coast at Mount Holyoke College. During this time, she spent a semester abroad studying in the Turks and Caicos Islands where she was captivated by the marine life as well as the challenge of managing human-environment relationships.
</p>
<p>
After spending a few years teaching math in Hawaii and then wrangling microbes at an algae biofuel startup in Florida, Molly is now a second-year master’s student at the UCSB Bren School of Environmental Science & Management. She came full circle back to the marine world, and is specializing in coastal and marine resources management and environmental data science. Her graduate work is focused on developing data management strategies for a local citizen science project run by the Channel Islands National Marine Sanctuary that monitors whale presence in the Santa Barbara Channel. As an OHI fellow and soon-to-be Bren graduate, she hopes to leverage her data science skills towards the preservation of both cultural and ecological systems.

### Camila Vargas

<div style="width: 100%;">
<img src="images/camila_pic.jpg" style="float: right; width: 34%; margin: 0px 6px;" />
<p>
Camila is originally from Santiago, Chile and holds a degree in Biology from Pontificia Universidad Católica de Chile (PUC), with a major in ecology and specialization in natural resources management. Her working experiences has mostly been related to academic research for the Marine Conservation Center – PUC, exploring social-ecological systems dynamics in small-scale fisheries in Chile.
</p>
<p>
Camila’s primary research focused on gender roles in small-scale fisheries along the coast of central Chile. She has also collaborated on a range of projects, from research to review biodiversity offset’s in the scientific literature, to an initiative with a PNUD project aimed to develop a credit system for marine biodiversity offsets for the central coast of Chile. She has also been involved in several field works assessing fishers’ perceptions on adaptive capacity and evaluating fishers’ collaborative behavior through game theory experiments.  

She recently graduated from her master degree at the Bren School of Environmental Science and Management, as a Latina America Fisheries Fellowship, with specialization is in Coastal Marine Resource Management. For her masters group thesis, Camila together with 4 colleagues worked on developing a user-friendly hub that integrates scientific knowledge, case studies and analitical tools for creating effective no-take marine reserves.

Her focus on marine resources is motivated by her passion for ocean and marine life as well as her desire to develop solutions, using the best available science, for threatened coastal resources which are the main livelihood for many coastal communities.

<div style="width: 100%;">
<img src="images/iwen_pic.jpg" style="float: right; width: 34%; margin: 0px 6px;" />
<p>
Iwen grew up in San Diego and Taiwan, and received her B.A. in Biology, Marine Emphasis from Occidental College. After graduating, she set off to Madagascar for three months to conduct underwater surveys on coral reefs. She has also volunteered on various projects throughout San Diego, including coral identification at the Scripps Institution of Oceanography, event planning for WildCoast, and scientific diving with San Diego State graduate students. During this time, Iwen primarily worked along the coast collecting recreational fisheries data for the CA Department of Fish and Wildlife and on the water for a white seabass enhancement project at the Hubbs-Seaworld Research Institute. 
</p>

<p>
She is now pursuing a specialization in Coastal and Marine Resources Management at the Bren School. Over the last year and half, she’s worked on various projects at NCEAS including the Arctic Data Center, the SeaSketch-TNC groundfish spatial plan, and now the Ocean Health Index. Her career interests include marine spatial planning for fisheries and aquaculture and seafood sustainability. Outside of school, Iwen enjoys diving artificial reefs, and drawing pictures of sea-creatures to hang on her walls.

<div style="width: 100%;">
<img src="images/ellie_pic.JPG" style="float: right; width: 39%; margin: 0px 6px;" />
<p>
Ellie graduated from the Bren School of Environmental Science & Management, where she pursued a Masters of Environmental Science and Management with a specialization in Energy and Climate. Originally from Anchorage, Alaska, Ellie graduated from Colorado College in 2016 with a B.A. in Mathematics. For her masters project, she collaborated with four peers to synthesize an ecological monitoring framework for the Tejon Ranch Conservancy, incorporating drones and other remote sensing technologies. She previously worked with Conservation Science Partners on GLUED (Global Land Use/Cover Emergent Database), a platform to collect and share data on land use and land cover. She gained additional technical training in remote sensing methodology through an interdisciplinary research experience for undergraduates at the University of Northern Iowa. In her free time, she enjoys spending time outdoors skiing, running, and playing ultimate frisbee.
