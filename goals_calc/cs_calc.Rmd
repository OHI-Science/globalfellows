The condition of coastal habitats that store and sequester atmospheric carbon.

\noindent
$\begin{aligned}
& x_{cs} \text{   is the status of the carbon storage goal}\\
\\
& x_{cs} = \left(\sum^N_{k=1} (h_k \times w_k \times A_k) \right) \left(\sum^N_{k=w} (w_k \times A_k) \right)^{-1} \\
\\
& h = \frac{C_c}{C_r}\\
\\
& h \text{   is a measure of carbon-storing habitat's condition with respect to its reference condition}\\
\\
& C_c \text{  is the current health of carbon-storing habitat $k$ (mangrove, saltmarsh, seagrass)}\\
& C_r \text{  is the reference condition of habitat $k$}\\
& w \text{  is the rank weight of the habitat's contribution to total carbon storage (Laffoley \& Grimsditch)}\\
& A \text{   is the area within a region for each $k$ habitat type}
\end{aligned}$
