The sustainable harvest of seafood from wild-caught fisheries.

\vspace{0.5in}

\noindent
$\begin{aligned}
& x_{fis} \text{   is the status of the wild-caught fisheries, fisheries food provision sub-goal}\\
\\
& x_{fis} = \prod^n_{i=1} SS_i^{\big(\frac{C_i}{\Sigma C_i} \big)} \\
\\
& \displaystyle{ SS = 
  \begin{cases}
    B/B_{MSY} , & \text{ if } B/B_{MSY} < 0.95 \\
    1 , & \text{ if } 0.95 \leq B/B_{MSY} \leq 1.05 \\
    max\{1 - \alpha(B/B_{MSY} - 1.05), \beta \} , & \text{ if } B/B_{MSY} > 1.05 \\
  \end{cases}
  } \\
\\
& SS \text{ are stock status scores}\\
& B/B_{MSY} \text{   is maximum sustainable yield for a stock}\\
& C_i\text{ }/\text{ }\Sigma C_i \text{  is the relative contribution of a stock $i$ to overall catch}\\
& C \text{   is the average catch since the first non null record, for each taxon within each region}\\
\\
& i \text{   is an individual taxon}\\
& n \text{   is the total number of taxa in the reported catch for each region throughout the time-series}\\
& \alpha \text{ set to be 0.5, status decline rate; under-harvest penalty is half of that for over-harvest of stocks}\\
& \beta \text{ is the minimum score a stock can get, set to 0.25}
