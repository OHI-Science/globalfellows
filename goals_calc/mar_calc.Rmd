The sustainable harvest of seafood from mariculture.

$\begin{aligned}
& x_{mar} \text{   is the status of the mariculture food provision sub-goal}\\
\\
& x_{mar} = \frac{Y_c}{Y_{c, \text{ } ref}}\\
\\
& Y_c = \left(\sum^N_{k=1} Y_k \times S_{k, r}\right)\left(\frac{1}{P_r}\right)\\
\\
& Y_c \text{   the current sustainably-harvested yield within each country, per person within 25 miles of region's coast}\\
& Y_k \text{   4-year moving average of tonnes of production for each $k$ species at some time cultured within a country}\\
& S_{k, r} \text{   is the sustainability score for each $k$ mariculture species and region}\\
& P_r \text{   is the population within 25 miles of the region's coast}\\
& Y_{c, \text{ } ref} \text{   is the $Y_c$ value that corresponds to the 95th quantile across all regions and years}\\
& N \text{  is the number of harvested mariculture species $k$}
