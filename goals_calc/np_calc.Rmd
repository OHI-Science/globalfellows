$\begin{aligned}
& x_{np} \text{   is the status of the natural products goal}\\
\\
& x_{np} = \left(\frac{1}{N}\right) \sum^N_{c=1} P_c \times w_c \\
\\
& P_c = H_c \times S_c\\
& S_c = 1 - \text{average}(E_c + R_c)\\
\\
& S_c \text{    is the sustainability of the commodity $c$}\\
& E_c \text{    is ln-transformed harvest intensity: tonnes harvested/km$^2$ of coral and/or rocky reef, relative to global max}\\
& R_c \text{    risk term based on whether commodity has unsustainable harvest practice, per CITES appendices II \& III}\\
& P_c \text{    is the status of natural product category $c$}\\
& H_c \text{   is the harvest level for a category relative to its own (buffered) peak reference point}\\
& w_c \text{   ratio of max value for product across years, to sum of max values for all products harvested in country}\\
& N \text{   the number of product categories $c$ harvested}
